 * AbstractVetoableChangeListener.java (c) 30 January 2005
 *
 * This class was created to accomodate the limitation that not all property change event sources may provide
 * functionality to register an event handler to apply only to a specified property.  One example of such a event
 * source is the JComponent class in the javax.swing package, which extends the java.awt.Component class.  The
 * JComponent class does not provide a method to register a VetoableChangeListener for a specified property of
 * the JComponent class.
